next thing(s) to do:
    ~~1) put state.card in fetch with method "POST" in body and write func in backend for fs.writeFileSync~~
    2) think about implementing redux
    3) let clicked card in modify popup as two textfields with the given text to modify
    4) think about implementing typescript
    ~~4) retrieve cards out of fs and show in frontend~~
